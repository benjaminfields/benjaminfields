Hi, I am Benjamin Njila Fields! I am a budding data scientist and computational social science researcher!

I am interested in big data, and how it can be used in development-related industries to optimize the human experience! 
      This includes how we can reform human education, health, and other types of systems!

I am currently proficient in basic statistical packages like SPSS and Stata, and am working on becoming advanced in R, Python, and SQL to further my career!
      I additionally have Java on my docket to learn in the next few months!

I am looking for data science internships in the education (language) and health spaces, preferably with big data. 
      I am very enthusiastic to jump on projects, as you can see I love using exclamation marks (haha)!
